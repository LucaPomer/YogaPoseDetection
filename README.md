# YogaPoseDetection
As part of my bachelor thesis I wrote this yoga pose detection program.
The program uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize yoga poses in still photographs.
### Languages
The entire project is written in python
### Third party libraries
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* OpenCv
* Keras
* Matplotlib
### References
The projects uses the [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) as part of the methodology.
